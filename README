Making Library:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --with-opensaml=/opt/moonshot/ --with-shibresolver=/opt/moonshot/ --with-shibsp=/opt/moonshot/
$ make

Testing Library with MIT GSS example programs:

1. Start Server as follows.

$ cd gss-sample
$ date -u
$ # create a file named "utc" in this directory with a time string formatted
$ # as "2012-03-27T19:50:21Z" (without the quotes)
$ # Also create a file named "id" in this dir with a random number such as
$ # "_893d6ce89d5da751180536d7a6b3b6673" (without the quotes)
$ # THE ABOVE 2 FILES NEED TO BE UPDATED BEFORE EACH RUN OF CLIENT
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/moonshot/lib64
$ ./gss-server -port 3490 test

2. Invoke client as follows.

$ cd gss-sample
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/moonshot/lib64
$ ./gss-client -port 3490 -user ysvenkat -pass password -mech "{ 1 3 6 1 4 1 11591 4 6 }" localhost test testmessage
