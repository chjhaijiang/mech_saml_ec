Installing required RPMs:

Instructions for obtaining Shibboleth RPMs are available at:

https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPLinuxRPMInstall

For RHEL/CentOS based systems the basic steps are:

(1) Create a new file /etc/yum.repos.d/shibboleth.repo:

# sudo echo \
'[Shibboleth]
name=Shibboleth
baseurl=http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security://shibboleth/<OS>
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

And replace the <OS> at the end of baseurl with the target operating system.

(2) Install required packages with "yum":

# sudo yum -y install \
    shibboleth \
    shibboleth-devel \
    libxerces-c-3_1 \
    libxerces-c-devel \
    libsaml7 \
    libsaml-devel \
    opensaml-schemas \
    liblog4shib1 \
    liblog4shib-devel \
    libxml-security-c16 \
    libxml-security-c-devel \
    libxmltooling5 \
    libxmltooling-devel \
    xmltooling-schemas \
    libevent \
    libxml2-devel \
    libtool \
    gcc gcc-c++

(3) If you are running RHEL6 (may also apply to CentOS6), you may encounter a
warning about libcurl which causes the library to segfault. This is due to
Red Hat using Netscape Security Services stack (NSS) instead of OpenSSL for
the curl libraries. See the following for more information:

https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPLinuxRH6

-------------------------------------

Configuration:

The library depends on correct configuration of the Shibboleth Service
Provider (SP) software. In particular, you need to choose an entityID for
your SP, create metadata for the SP (which is needed by any Identity Provider
(IdP) you use), and configure a few files in /etc/shibboleth/.  In
particular, you need to modify the following files.

(1) /etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml 
This is the main Shibboleth SP configuration file. You should be able to use
the provided shibboleth2.xml.dist file as a starting point. You must set the
following sections:
  (a) <ApplicationDefaults entityID="https://your.org/shibboleth"
                     REMOTE_USER="persistent-id targeted-id eppn"
                     signing="true">
      The entityID is set to your chosen entityID and must match the entityID
      in the metadata for the SP. "signing" must be set to true so that SAML
      messages passed between the server and client are signed.
  (b) <MetadataProvider ...>
      You must have at least one MetadataProvider section so the library
      can verify the IdP used to authenticate the user. 

(2) /etc/shibboleth/attribute-map.xml
In order to get a local user name for the authenticated user, you must map
one attribute released by the IdP to "local-login-user". This actually
requires two steps:
  (a) The IdP must be configured to release an attribute to your SP's
      entityID.  It's not critical WHICH attribute is released, as long as
      the IdP and SP agree. For this discussion, let's say the IdP has
      released "givenName" (urn:oid:2.5.4.42).
  (b) On the SP side, map this attribute to "local-login-user" by adding the
      following to attribute-map.xml:
      <Attribute name="urn:oid:2.5.4.42" id="local-login-user"/>

-------------------------------------

Testing your IdP configuration:

Before trying the SAML EC GSS mechanism, first confirm that your SAML
IdP supports the SAML ECP Profile. A testecp.sh shell script (from the
Shibboleth project) is provided for this purpose. Edit the testecp.sh
file to set the needed parameters, then run it:

# ./testecp.sh 
Enter host password for user 'example':
ECP request successful!

-------------------------------------

Building The Code:

# ./autogen.sh
# ./configure
# make

-------------------------------------

Running in Debug Mode

Copious debugging info can be seen by setting the environment variable
MECH_SAML_EC_DEBUG.

    $ export MECH_SAML_EC_DEBUG=anyvalue

-------------------------------------

More configuration

Place the following in ~/.gss_saml_ec_cb_type:
tls-server-end-point

-------------------------------------

Testing Library with MIT GSS example programs:

1. Start Server as follows. In one window, run:

# ./testserver.sh

   - OR -

# cd gss-sample
# ./gss-server -port 3490 test


2. Invoke client as follows. In a second window, run:

# ./testclient.sh <username> <password>

   - OR -

# cd gss-sample
# export SAML_EC_IDP='https://idp.protectnetwork.org/protectnetwork-idp/profile/SAML2/SOAP/ECP'    # Use your IdP's ECP endpoint
# ./gss-client -nw -nx -nm -port 3490 -user <username> -pass <password> -mech "{ 1 3 6 1 4 1 11591 4 6 }" localhost host@fqdn testmessage # must match host@fqdn in AssertionConsumerService Location 

-------------------------------------

Using ProtectNetwork's IdP:

If you don't have an ECP-enabled IdP already, one option is to use
ProtectNetwork.

First, federate your SP with the ProtectNetwork IdP:

http://www.protectnetwork.org/support/integrate-protectnetwork-metadata/shibboleth-sp2x

As documented on the above page, you must configure your SP with
ProtectNetwork's metadata and register your SP with ProtectNetwork.

To register your SP with ProtectNetwork, you must first apply for a
ProtectNetwork Administrator account:

https://www.protectnetwork.org/pnidm/adminRegistration.html

Then use the 'Administrator Login' link:

https://www.protectnetwork.org/pnidm/admin/login.jsp

Then click the Add Site button to add a new SP and wait for approval.

To actually log in via SAML ECP, you need to register for a
ProtectNetwork UserID:

https://www.protectnetwork.org/pnidm/registration.html

Finally, you can use the ProtectNetwork IdP's ECP endpoint to log in
with your ProtectNetwork UserID and password:

export SAML_EC_IDP='https://idp.protectnetwork.org/protectnetwork-idp/profile/SAML2/SOAP/ECP'

-------------------------------------

Using with OpenSSH for User Authentication:

Download and install latest krb5 (>= 1.10) from http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/

  cd krb5-1.10.3/src
  CFLAGS=-g ./configure --prefix=$HOME/krb5-install --enable-shared
  make
  make install

Place the following in $HOME/krb5-install/etc/gss/mech :
saml-ec 1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.4.6 mech_saml_ec.so

Place mech_saml_ec.so in $HOME/krb5-install/lib/gss/

Place the following in $HOME/krb5-install/etc/krb5.conf :
[libdefaults]
    default_realm = YOUR_DOMAIN_ALL_CAPS

Download and install Project Moonshot OpenSSH modified for SAML EC

  git clone git@github.com:jbasney/moonshot-openssh.git
  cd moonshot-openssh/
  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/openssh-moonshot --with-kerberos5=$HOME/krb5-install
  make install

  NOTE: If krb5 version is too old, compiler errors would look like:

      undefined reference to `gss_pname_to_uid'
      undefined reference to `gss_userok'

Put your username/password with the IdP in ~/.gss_eap_id, like:
username
password

Enable GSSAPI, disable Privilege Separation in openssh-moonshot/etc/sshd_config:

  GSSAPIAuthentication yes
  UsePrivilegeSeparation no

Enable GSSAPI in openssh-moonshot/etc/ssh_config:

  GSSAPIAuthentication yes

Run Server as root:

  # cd openssh-moonshot/sbin
  # ./sshd -p 2222 -ddd -r

Run Client:

  $ # First set IdP as shown next
  $ export SAML_EC_IDP=https://idp.protectnetwork.org/protectnetwork-idp/profile/SAML2/SOAP/ECP
  $ cd openssh-moonshot/bin
  $ ./ssh -vvv -p 2222 fqdn # must match host@fqdn in AssertionConsumerService Location
